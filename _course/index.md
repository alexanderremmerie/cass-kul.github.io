This website is the source of all information regarding the exercise sessions of the
Computer Architecture and System Software course.

We are trying a new approach this year by providing the exercise sessions in the format
of web pages, please don't hesitate to give us feedback on this!

# Exercises

There are 9 exercise sessions in total. The material available on this website contains
both the theory, the exercises, and the solutions. The solutions are hidden until the end
of each week.

Please bring your laptops to the exercise sessions. You can work at your own pace, and don't
be afraid of asking questions from the teaching assistant. If you don't have time to finish
the exercises, it is recommended to finish them before starting the next session.

Even if the solutions are already visible, it is strongly recommended to first write the
solutions on your own (even using external resources, if you understand them) before you
look at the provided solutions.

# YouTube videos

There are videos available from last year, where the theory of each session is explained.
These videos might help with understanding the concepts, but watching them is not required,
and they do not substitute working through the material yourself, as there might be new
content included this year.
